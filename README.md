# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
## Overview
Voice technology has many applications in the modern world. Consumers have come to expect voice interactions in smartphones, home devices, and services. In addition, a project that uses AI to learn the voices of popular singers to recreate their songs has recently attracted attention. Based on these trends, we have started a new project using WIZnet IoT speaker with AI TTS technology and singer voice recreation technology.
